👋 Hi, I'm Pradeep from Seeker Labs
Welcome to my GitHub!
Here’s what I’m currently building:


🍓 Circuit Seekers
A hands-on hub for end-to-end PCB and firmware development.
From circuit design to final embedded code — we bring hardware ideas to life.
We turn ideas into functional hardware. Whether you're a startup, student, or researcher — join us in building the future, one circuit at a time.


🐝  ProgramBees
The software wing — focused on AI, ML, and full-stack solutions.
It’s where our code meets curiosity and we prototype, train, and build smart systems.
Building the future — one wire and one line of code at a time.
Let’s connect. Collaborate. Create.
